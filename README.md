data-structures
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhp81/cf-data-structures.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhp81/cf-data-structures)

This repository holds code for a number of classic data structures, implemented in Python and written for the Code Fellows Python Bootcamp.

These data structures are:

* Single Linked List

* Stack

* **Queue**
A Queue with the following methods:
enqueue(value): adds value to the queue
dequeue(): removes the correct item from the queue and returns its value (should raise an error if the queue is empty)
size(): return the size of the queue.  Should return 0 if the queue is empty.
