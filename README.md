[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lhp81/cf-data-structures.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lhp81/cf-data-structures)

This repository holds code for a number of classic data structures, implemented in Python and written for the Code Fellows Python Bootcamp.

These data structures are:

* **Single Linked List** _A Single Linked List that canâ€¦_
 * insert(val) will insert the value 'val' at the head of the list
 * pop() will pop the first value off the head of the list and return it.
 * size() will return the length of the list
 * search(val) will return the node containing 'val' in the list, if present, else None
 * remove(node) will remove the given node from the list, wherever it might be (node must be an item in the list
 * print() will print the list represented as a Python tuple literal: "(12, 'sam', 37, 'tango')" 
  *bonus if you can make it so that the list appears this way on its own (remember special methods).


* **Stack** _A Stack that can implement two methods:_
 * push(data) - Adds a data element to the stack. The parameter is the data element to add to the stack.
 * pop() - Removes a data element from the stack and returns the value of that data element.  If the stack is empty, attempts to call pop should raise an appropriate Python exception class.

* **Queue** _A Queue with the following methods:_
 * enqueue(value): adds value to the queue
 * dequeue(): removes the correct item from the queue and returns its value (should raise an error if the queue is empty)
 * size(): return the size of the queue.  Should return 0 if the queue is empty.
