This is an implementation of a stack.
It was created to meet the following requirements:

    1. push(data) - Adds a data element to the stack

    2. pop() - pop() - Removes a data element from the stack and returns the
    value of that data element.
    If the stack is empty, attempts to call pop should raise an appropriate 
    Python exception class.

    3. Your implementation is not allowed to use the built-in Python list,
    tuple or dictionary.  Nor are you allowed to use any of the native
    implementations.

    4. Design using BDD or unittest.

BDD using lettuce was used to create the above.
